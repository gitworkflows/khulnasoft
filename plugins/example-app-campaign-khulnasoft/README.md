## Getting started

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khulnasoft-com/khulnasoft.git
cd plugins/example-simple-app
npm install
```

### Develop

```bash
npm start
```

### Add the plugin in Khulnasoft.com

From [khulnasoft.com](https://khulnasoft.com) open the javascript console in your browser's dev tools and run.

```js
// Adds the plugin
khulnasoft.plugins.replace(['http://localhost:1268/plugin.system.js'])
// Saves for all in your organization and reloads the browser
khulnasoft.savePlugins().then(() => location.reload())
```

**NOTE:** Loading http:// content on an https:// website will give you a warning. Be sure to click the shield in the top right of your browser and choose "load unsafe scripts" to allow the http content on Khulnasoft's https site when devloping locally
