## Getting started

Add your default and alternate locales. These locales must also be configured in your NextJS i18n config. Currently supports path based localization (ie /fr).

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khulnasoft-com/khulnasoft.git
cd plugins/localization
npm install
```

### Develop

```bash
npm start
```

### Add the plugin in Khulnasoft.com

From [khulnasoft.com](https://khulnasoft.com) open the javascript console in your browser's dev tools and run.

```js
// Adds the plugin
khulnasoft.plugins.replace(['http://localhost:1268/plugin.system.js'])
// Saves for all in your organization and reloads the browser
khulnasoft.savePlugins().then(() => location.reload())
```

**NOTE:** Loading http:// content on an https:// website will give you a warning. Be sure to click the shield in the top right of your browser and choose "load unsafe scripts" to allow the http content on Khulnasoft's https site when devloping locally

Now as you develop you can restart Khulnasoft to see the latest version of your plugin.

To uninstall your plugin run

```js
// Removes all plugins
khulnasoft.plugins.replace([])
// Saves for all in your organization and reloads the browser
khulnasoft.savePlugins().then(() => location.reload())
```
